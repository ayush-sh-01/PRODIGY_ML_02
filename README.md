Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Project Overview

This project focuses on segmenting customers of a shopping mall based on their purchasing behavior. Using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (K-Means clustering), customers are grouped according to their Annual Income and Spending Score.
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different types of customers and plan targeted marketing strategies.
